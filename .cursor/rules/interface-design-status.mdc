# Design System Status

Show current design system state.

## What to Show

**If `.interface-design/system.md` exists:**

Display:
```
Design System: [Project Name]

```

**If no system.md:**

```
No design system found.

Options:
1. Build UI → system will be established automatically
2. Run extract → pull patterns from existing code
```

## Implementation

1. Read `.interface-design/system.md`
2. Parse direction, tokens, patterns
3. Format and display
4. If no system, suggest next steps
